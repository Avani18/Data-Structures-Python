# Data-Structures-Python
This repository contains various Data Structures implemented in Python.

I have categorised all the Data Structures in separate folders. 
Each code file is well commented for everyone's readability. This also makes it easy to understand the code who are new to this.
In each file, its main function is described line by line.

Hope it helps all those who reached here!
